# coin_toss

an insanely simple coin_toss utility that you can use. Built for windows. Will have to run from source and create own binaries if want on mac/linux

## Installation

use `.exe` binary. Download it. add it to your path, call `ct` (short for rock paper scissors) to run the utility. Or rename to whatever you want. Detailed steps:
1. Download package and unzip, rename `.exe` to `ct`.
2. Put the binary (the `.exe`) in a folder it can live permanently.
3. Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables
4. Edit the PATH variable
5. Add the **directory** containing the executable, separating it with semicolons if needed.
6. Restart PC if needed, or refresh terminal. 
7. Type `ct` in terminal. It should run

## Usage

just run `ct` from command line

## Development
